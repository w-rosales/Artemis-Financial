# Artemis-Financial
**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
Artemis Financial is a finance consulting firm. THrough Global Rain and a team of developers, they wanted to make their services available through a new web application. Artemis Financial focuses their services on savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The main focus of this new web application was to ensure secure communication between the user and the application due to the amount of sensitive information needed. This web application would allow for their customers to upload files and access their own personal accounts. 

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**
I generated checksum values in order to ensure that data transfer within the application was being performed securely. Practicing secure coding methods is important for both the customer and Artemis Financial. Using these safe coding practices may help prevent future attacks and ensure customer and company's privacy for their sensitive information. 

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
Familiarity with the Maven dependency check was quite challenging to understand at first glance. There is a lot of information per dependency that was displayed, but thankfully it does include some details and information about the dependency. These dependency checks are very important for a web application since it exposing the vulnerabilities for the application. We are able to identify areas of improvement and areas that may need to be updated in order to ensure security.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
I used an extra layer of security by developing a self assigned SSL certificate in order for sensitive information to be transferred. Multi-layered authentication is a route that I would take in the future to ensure that the application stays secure. With the development of new requirements from Artemis Financial and new techniques that may be introduced, the system's security must be able to adapt and keep both the customer and company secure. 

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
I was able to run the code and be able to see if the connection to HTTPS was secure or not. I was also able to develop another dependency check in order to see if there were any new vulnerabilities that were introduced after adjusting the previous code. 

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
I used the hyperlinks that were displayed in the Dependency Check report to learn how to read the report and interact with the page. I also used the Spring.io website in order to learn more about the uses of the Spring Framework and what other intentions it could be used for. There are also error messages that display within Eclipse that can give me a general idea of what tasks I need to fix. Using all of these resources helped me understand what type of web application I was making and the structural work it needed in order to function properly.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
I would show employers the vulnerability reports before and after adjusting code. I also believe that the documentation that we have done for both projects 1 and 2 are a great way to showcase knowledge. Having clear documentation will benefit in effective communication with a team and documentation will also help summarize my findings and adjustments in the project.
